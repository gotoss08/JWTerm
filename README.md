# JWTerm - Virtual Terminal Screen Emulator

Currently in **WIP** status

## Description
`JWTerm` is a basic virtual terminal screen emulator written in Java. It is intended for use in roguelike game development, providing a minimalistic and efficient way to render text-based screens. The emulator does not rely on any external libraries, using only Java's built-in Swing and AWT libraries. This makes it lightweight and easy to integrate into Java projects that require terminal-like interfaces.

Currently, the emulator supports rendering basic characters using the Fixedsys font, offering a retro aesthetic for text-based games.

## Features
- **Terminal Screen Emulation**: Simulates a virtual terminal window, ideal for roguelike games or any text-based applications.
- **Fixedsys Font**: Uses the Fixedsys font for retro-style text rendering, enhancing the terminal-like experience.
- **Lightweight**: Written purely in Java with no external dependencies, leveraging Swing and AWT for graphical components.
- **Open Source**: JWTerm is free and open-source under the MIT License, allowing modification and redistribution.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JWTerm.git
   ```
2. Open project in IntelliJ Idea
3. Run `JWTerm` configuration

## Usage
JWTerm currently renders basic characters on a window, simulating a terminal screen. This can be used for developing roguelike games or any text-based applications that require a terminal interface.

1. Once the application runs, a window will open displaying a virtual terminal screen.
2. The screen is ready to display text-based information such as game statuses, player messages, and more.
